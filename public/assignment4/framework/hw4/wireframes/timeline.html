He also wanted to settle border disputes with Great Britain regarding the Oregon Territory. Polk threatened Great Britain with war over the northern boundary to the west. He said that the U.S. wanted the territory all the way to the 54-40 line, just south of Alaska. A popular slogan of the day was "54-40 or fight". Britain later agreed to a border at the 49th parallel, which is today the border between the U.S. and Canada. Polk was happy about this settlement as he never really wanted to go war with Britain.</div>

As a result, they kicked him out of the party and all but one of the cabinet members resigned. They even tried to impeach him saying that he misused his veto power. The impeachment failed, however. Tyler was a strong proponent of states' rights. This meant that he thought state governments should have more power and the federal government less power. States should be able to set their own laws without the federal government interfering. His policies regarding states' rights caused a further riff and separation between the northern and southern states. This likely had some influence and helped to cause the Civil War.</div>

Unfortunately, the US was in no position to fight the British and lost many battles, including one where the British marched on Washington DC and burned down the White House. However, the final battle of the war, the Battle of Orleans, was a victory led by General Andrew Jackson. This helped the country to feel they had done well and raised Madison's popularity.</div>

George stepped down from the presidency after 8 years, or two terms. He felt it was important that the president not become powerful or rule too long, like a king.
