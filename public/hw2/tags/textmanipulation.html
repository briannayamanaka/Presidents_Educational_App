                <blockquote cite="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dstefan/cse130-winter17/">
                    <p>This course will cover basic concepts and design trade-offs related to programming languages. The first half of the course focuses on functions, types, scope, storage management, exceptions, and continuations. The second half covers object-oriented features and concurrency. We will conclude with a few special-topics in programming languages. The class also has a number of small labs where students get to implement some of the language features discussed in class.</p>
